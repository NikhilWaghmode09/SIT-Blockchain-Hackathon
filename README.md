## Introduction

Welcome to our Blockchain Hackathon repository! We have developed blockchain-based solutions to address various real-world challenges. Our smart contracts demonstrate how blockchain technology can enhance transparency, security, and trust in different domains.

## Problem Statements⏳

### 1) Blockchain-Based Voting System 🌐
**Problem Statement:** 
Traditional voting systems face challenges related to transparency and security. This smart contract provides a secure and transparent platform for casting and recording votes. It ensures the integrity of the electoral process by guaranteeing the permanence of voter choices and fostering transparency. 
- [Code](VoteSys.sol)


### 2) Blockchain-Based Academic Certificate Verification System 📃
**Problem Statement:** 
Verifying academic certificates can be cumbersome and prone to fraud. Our smart contract simplifies academic certificate verification, providing a secure and transparent method for recording and verifying academic credentials. It enhances the credibility of educational qualifications.
- [Code](CertificateVerification.sol)


### 3) Blockchain-Based Digital Art Ownership Tracking System 🎨
**Problem Statement:** 
Proving ownership and provenance of digital art can be challenging. Our smart contract securely manages the ownership and provenance of digital art pieces. It simplifies digital art ownership tracking, fostering trust among artists and collectors.
- [Code](ArtOwnership.sol)

  
### 4) Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Tracking System 🚚
**Problem Statement:** 
Supply chains often lack transparency, leading to inefficiencies and accountability issues. This contract demonstrates the potential of blockchain in enhancing supply chain transparency and traceability. It accurately records product movements, promoting trust and accountability within the supply chain ecosystem.

## Smart Contracts📄

We have developed a series of smart contracts within the Remix IDE to address these problem statements. Each smart contract is designed to address specific problem statement.

## Key Benefits📌
